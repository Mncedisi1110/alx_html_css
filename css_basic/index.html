        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Mncedisi Ntshingila is a student at ALX Foundations studying towards a software engineering( front end development) certificate. I’m passionate about tech and learning more about computer systems or software. Moreover, I have good communication skills and I am also a good listener. I apply these skills at work as I am working as an assistant teacher at Esithebeni Primary school. I have a good understanding of mathematics and science, proof that I was able to obtain distinctions in those subjects at school when I was in grade 12. With these skills combined with a growth mindset I can meet the culture and values of the tech world in any company. Working in companies that involve a lot of programming projects will help me live out my passion.</p>
